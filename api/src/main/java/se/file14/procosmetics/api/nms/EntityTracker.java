/**
 * Manages visibility and lifecycle of a group of NMS entities.

 * visibility predicates. Trackers run periodic updates to maintain viewer lists
 * and can be configured with callbacks for viewer and entity lifecycle events.
 *
 * <p>Typical usage involves creating a tracker via the {@link Builder}, adding
 * entities, and calling {@link #startTracking()} to begin automatic viewer management.</p>
