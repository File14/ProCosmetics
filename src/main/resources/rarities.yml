#
# Rarities represent how special a cosmetic item is, such as common, rare, or legendary.
#
# Rarities are used to influence the odds of obtaining cosmetics in treasure chests.
# Higher rarities should appear less frequently, and lower rarities should be more common
# Higher rarities often appear only in more expensive treasure chests.
#
# You can customize existing rarities and add new ones as needed.
# IMPORTANT:
# If you rename a default rarity (e.g., "common"), remember to update all references to it in the cosmetics config files.
# Use the replace-all function to simplify this process.
