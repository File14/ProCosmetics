#
# Rarities are markers that identify the rarity of a cosmetic item, such as common or super rare.
# They DO NOT affect the odds of obtaining items in the treasure chest.
# Their purpose is to enhance the player's experience by creating a sense of excitement when receiving a rare item.
# For example, receiving gadget ammo is not as exciting as receiving a cool particle effect.
#
# Rarities are mainly used and displayed when receiving cosmetics in the treasure chests.
# For example, when you receive a cosmetic it shows:
# <rarity_secondary_color> Gadget
# <rarity_primary_color> TNT
#
# You can customize existing rarities and add new ones as needed.
# The default color scheme works as follows: the main color should be brighter than the secondary color and should be within the same color range.
# PLEASE NOTE: If you rename a default rarity (e.g., "common" and not name: "common"), remember to update all references to it in the cosmetics config files. Use the replace-all function to simplify this process.
# PLEASE NOTE: Money & Gadget ammo will always fall back to the FIRST rarity listed below. It is defined as the most common rarity.
